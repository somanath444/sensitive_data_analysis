Utilizing historical data, this project aimed to analyze trends and forecast sexual assault cases in India. Despite working with limited and synthetic data from 2013-2023
due to the scarcity of original data, we observed a concerning trend. The ACF and PACF analysis revealed a significant spike in crimes, with a 30% increase noted in the original data.

Though the LSTM model struggled with performance on synthetic data, the findings highlighted a grim reality: 96% of offenders were known to their victims. 
This analysis underscores the urgent need for proactive measures and further investigation into the increasing rates of assault, reflecting a deeply troubling trend.
